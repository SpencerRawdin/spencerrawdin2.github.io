<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hello, I’m Spencer! Recently, I completed my Bachelor’s in Business Administration and am now venturing into the world of data analytics and data science. My previous roles in eKYC Solutions and AML Compliance have given me a solid foundation in handling data, and I have a particular affinity for working with data visualization tools. Specializing in Business and Economic Geography has allowed me to build a portfolio in Tableau and ArcGIS Pro, which you can explore right here on my page.</p> <p>In my free time I enjoy exploring. A couple projects I’m currently engaged in include:</p> <ul> <li>Exploring traditional and quantitative theories and strategies in financial markets</li> <li>Learning Oracle MySQL</li> </ul> <p>If you’re interested in collaboration or simply want to get in touch, please contact me.</p> <ul> <li>Contact me at <strong>rawdin.spencer@gmail.com</strong> if interested!</li> </ul> </body></html>
